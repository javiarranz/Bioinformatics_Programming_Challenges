### **QUERIES RESULTS**

UNIPROT
----------------------------------------------------------------
How many protein records are in UniProt? 
```
281303435
```

How many Arabidopsis thaliana protein records are in UniProt? 
```
89182
```
What is the description of the enzyme activity of UniProt Protein Q9SZZ8
```
Beta-carotene + 4 reduced ferredoxin [iron-sulfur] cluster + 2 H(+) + 2 O(2) = zeaxanthin + 4 oxidized ferredoxin [iron-sulfur] cluster + 2 H(2)O.
```
Retrieve the proteins ids, and date of submission, for proteins that have been added to UniProt this year   (HINT Google for “SPARQL FILTER by date”)
```
58202805
```
How  many species are in the UniProt taxonomy?
```
1766921
```
How many species have at least one protein record? 
```
984622
```

ATLAS
----------------------------------------------------------------
What is the Affymetrix probe ID for the Arabiodopsis Apetala3 gene?  
```
NO ANSWER - email
```
get the experimental description for all experiments where the Arabidopsis Apetala3 gene is DOWN regulated 
```
??
```

REACTOME
----------------------------------------------------------------
How many REACTOME pathways are assigned to Arabidopsis (taxon 3702)?
```
809
```
get all PubMed references for the pathway with the name “Degradation of the extracellular matrix
```
output in a list
```
----------------------------------------------------------------
find the AGI codes and gene names for all Arabidopsis thaliana  proteins that have a protein function annotation description that mentions “pattern formation”
```
table with AGIs and the name of the gene
```
write a query that proves that all Arabidopsis pathway annotations in Reactome are “inferred from electronic annotation
```
count1: 654481 	// 	count2: 654481
THIS MEANS THAT THE 100% of the pathways annotations are “inferred from electronic annotation”
```
